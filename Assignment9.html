<h2>COMPUTER</h2>	
<p>
	A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow generalized sequences of operations, called programs, enable them to perform a wide range of tasks.
</p>

<a id="cpu"></a>
<h3>CPU</h3>
<p>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.</p>

<a id="alu"></a>
<h3>ALU</h3>
<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs.

<a id="programming languages"></a>
<h2>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h2>
<p>A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>

<a id="c"></a>
<h3>C</h3>
<p>C ( as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>

<a id="c++"></a>
<h3>C++</h3>
<p>++ (pronounced cee plus plus ) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights</p>

<a id="dbms"></a>
<h2>DBMS</h2>
<p>A database management system (DBMS) is a computer software application that interacts with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases. Well-known DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, SAP HANA, MemSQL, SQLite and IBM DB2. A database is not generally portable across different DBMSs, but different DBMS can interoperate by using standards such as SQL and ODBC or JDBC to allow a single application to work with more than one DBMS.</p>

<a id="rdbms"></a>
<h3>RDBMS</h3>
<p>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as invented by E. F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. In 2017, many of the databases in widespread use are based on the relational database model.RDBMSs have been a common choice for the storage of information in new databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical information, personnel data, and other applications since the 1980s. Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases because they are easier to understand and use. </p>

<a id="oodbms"></a>
<h3>OODBMS</h3>
<p>An object database (also object-oriented database management system, OODBMS) is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. Object databases are different from relational databases which are table-oriented. Object-relational databases are a hybrid of both approaches.</p>

<a id="hdbms"></a>
<h3>HDBMS</h3>
<p>A DBMS is said to be hierarchical DBMS, when the data is organized like a tree structure. That means, it simply represents the data using parent â€“ child relationship. It is the oldest style of organizing/storing data and still some organizations are using this.It follows one to many relationship. i.e. All parents can have more than one child, but each child should have only one parent.</p>

<a id="ndbms"></a>
<h3>NDBMS</h3>
<p>A DBMS is said to be Network DBMS, when it organizes the data in a network structure. As you all are aware that, a network may have as many connections as it can. In our DBMS language, we can say that a parent can have many children and a child can have more than one parent. So a Network DBMS will have many-to-many relationship.
